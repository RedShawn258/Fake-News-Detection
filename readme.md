### About
1) This is a On going research project on Fake news detection
2) The model aims to detect whether a given news article is real or fake
3) We used BERT(Bi directional Encoder Representation from Transformers) for extraction  contextual information
4) For image feature extraction we used VGG19

Obtained two feature vectors are then concatenated to give resulting news vector.
